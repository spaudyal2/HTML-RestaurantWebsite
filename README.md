# Web-Auth-Fundamentals--Final_Assignm
4th and Final Assignment to the HTML course.

In this assignment we had to either replicate a existing website or create a entire website for a company. 
I decided to both replicate but update few things for a restaurant website. The original website for the restaurant is www.sabitris.com
